This is a repository of example cryptographic algorithms and their explainations.

This should contain both symetric and assymetric algorithms as well as other types of algorithms. If this doesn't look exhaustive yet that is because like most git repos it is a work in progress.

Here is an overview of the reasons why you should learn and know this subject.

Cryptography is the study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversaries. It is a fundamental aspect of computer science and information security and is used in various applications including data encryption, digital signatures, and secure communication protocols.

As a student of computer science or information security, learning cryptographic algorithms is essential for several reasons.

Better understanding of security concepts: Studying cryptography helps students gain a deeper understanding of security concepts such as confidentiality, integrity, and authentication. By learning how cryptographic algorithms can be used to achieve these objectives, students gain a deeper appreciation for the importance of security and the role that cryptography plays in protecting sensitive information.

Relevance to modern computing: Cryptographic algorithms are widely used in various applications and protocols, from secure email and instant messaging to e-commerce and online banking. A solid understanding of cryptography is essential for anyone working in the field of computer science or information security, as it is a fundamental tool for ensuring the privacy and security of sensitive information in the digital age.

Career opportunities: As the importance of cryptography continues to grow, there is an increasing demand for professionals with expertise in this field. This makes learning cryptographic algorithms an excellent investment for students seeking careers in computer science or information security. Knowledge of cryptography can also make a student more competitive in the job market and increase their earning potential.

Some of the most widely used cryptographic algorithms include:

Symmetric key algorithms: Symmetric key algorithms use the same key for both encryption and decryption. Examples include the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and the Data Encryption Standard (DES).

Asymmetric key algorithms: Asymmetric key algorithms use two different keys, one for encryption and one for decryption. Examples include the RSA algorithm and the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) algorithm.

Hash functions: Hash functions are used to generate a fixed-length output, called a hash, from an input of arbitrary length. Examples include the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) and the Message Digest 5 (MD5) algorithm.

Learning cryptographic algorithms is an important part of computer science and information security education. It provides students with a deeper understanding of security concepts, relevance to modern computing, and career opportunities. With the continued growth in the importance of cryptography, students who learn these algorithms are well positioned for success in their careers and in their contribution to a more secure digital world.
